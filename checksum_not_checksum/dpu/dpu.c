/**
 * An example of checksum computation with multiple tasklets.
 *
 * Every tasklet processes specific areas of the MRAM, following the "rake"
 * strategy:
 *  - Tasklet number T is first processing block number TxN, where N is a
 *    constant block size
 *  - It then handles block number (TxN) + (NxM) where M is the number of
 *    scheduled tasklets
 *  - And so on...
 *
 * The host is in charge of computing the final checksum by adding all the
 * individual results.
